used viola jones method for face detection
used hough transform to extract the eyes from the image
the entire face should be seen in the image and only then the viola-jones method will be implemented

first an image is taken using the web camera
it is converted into a black and white image
the image is flipped horizontally as the camera takes a mirror image
boundary of the extracted image is created using the detector
if there are two faces in the image, it will take the bigger of the two
once this is done, the imcrop function is used to extract the eyes from the image
then the location of the eyeball is detected using the detector
imfindcircles function is used to detect the circles in the image of the specified radius, in this case the eyeballs
the distance of the eyeball from the center of the eye is calculated, both left and right
if the distance from the right is less as compared to the left, then the eyeball is towards the right
else if left is less then left
otherwise eyeball is in the centre
